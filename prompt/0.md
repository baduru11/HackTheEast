  stock price*, price change %, P/E ratio, market cap, insider sentiment score*, analyst recommendation*, etc) then fetch url of articles for TRAFILATURA to scrap        
  article content(full article body text, author name, publication date, site name, categories & tags, article language, images, etc). Then these data are fed in         
  parallet(per article) to generate summary+financial learning+mcq quizes. Home page contains main headliner news from various sectors. Our sectors include               
  world(asia,amercia,china,europe,india,japan,war), markets(crypto,stock,options,sector,bonds,currency,world indices,etfs). Top navbar contains webpage name, World,

  image) user enters tab containing summary/tutorial, link to original article, link to mcq quizes. Upon signing up, user selects sub-sector they want to favourite. for  
  each favourite sectors, theres gauge meter that starts from 50(0-100), which user can fill it up by solving mcq quizes of related articles in that sector. When gauge
